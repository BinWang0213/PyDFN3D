### Install


`PyDFN3D` is currently support for `64-bit` `Windows` and `Linux` platforms, several `Jupyter-Notebook` examples are provided.

`Anaconda 5.3` (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is required. If code is not working, please run `python setup.py build_ext -i clean` @ "PyDFN3D\Flow_Solver\PyBEM2D\PyBEM2D\BEM_Solver\Elements" in terminal to compile the cython library for exact integration. The library works on both Windows and Linux.
